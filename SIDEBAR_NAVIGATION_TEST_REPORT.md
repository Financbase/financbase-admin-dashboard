## 🚨 Issues Found

1. **Broken Navigation Links** (6 pages return 404)
   - Users will click on sidebar links expecting pages
   - Creates poor UX when links don't work

2. **Inconsistent Routing**
   - Some links exist: `/dashboard`, `/invoices`, `/expenses`
   - Some don't: `/transactions`, `/analytics`, `/accounts`

3. **Sidebar Configuration Issue**
   - Sidebar shows links to pages that don't exist
   - Should either:
     - Create the missing pages, OR
     - Remove/disable the links until pages are ready

---

## 💡 Recommended Action Plan

### Option 1: Create Missing Pages (Recommended)
Create placeholder pages for all 404 routes with:
- "Coming Soon" message
- Brief description of planned features
- Link back to dashboard
- Maintains professional appearance

### Option 2: Update Sidebar
Remove or disable non-existent links:
- Comment out missing navigation items
- Add "Coming Soon" badges
- Only show working pages

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Create simple placeholder pages for core features (Transactions, Analytics, Accounts)
2. Mark advanced features as "Coming Soon" in sidebar
3. Focus on completing high-priority pages first

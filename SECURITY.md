# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Financbase admin dashboard to ensure enterprise-grade security and compliance.

## ‚úÖ Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Clerk Integration**: Multi-factor authentication, social login, and enterprise SSO
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic logout
- **Password Policies**: Enforced complexity requirements and rotation policies

### 2. Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all user inputs and API endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with Drizzle ORM
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for state-changing operations

### 3. Network Security
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers including:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS
  - `Content-Security-Policy` - Controls resource loading
  - `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes)
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic must use HTTPS in production

### 4. File Security
- **Git LFS Configuration**: Large binary files tracked with Git LFS
- **File Upload Validation**: Type, size, and content validation
- **Secure File Storage**: UploadThing integration with access controls

### 5. API Security
- **API Route Protection**: Authentication required for all protected endpoints
- **Request Validation**: Schema validation for all API requests
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin policies

### 6. Monitoring & Compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security events
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and alerting
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC 2, GDPR, and financial regulation compliance
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security testing and dependency auditing

## üîí Security Headers Configuration

The following security headers are automatically applied to all routes:

```javascript
{
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.financbase.com https://js.clerk.com; ..."
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Middleware Security

The middleware provides additional security layers:

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Route Protection**: Automatic authentication checks
- **Request Validation**: Security headers for API responses
- **IP Tracking**: For security monitoring and abuse prevention

## üìä Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests
```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
pnpm run test:security

# Run dependency vulnerability scan
pnpm audit

# Run all security tests
pnpm run test:all
```

### Manual Security Checks
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Code review for security best practices
- Penetration testing before major releases
- Security configuration reviews

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time security event logging
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Regular security incident drills
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance

### Vulnerability Management
- Automated vulnerability scanning with Dependabot
- Security patch management process
- Zero-day vulnerability response procedures
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure

## üìã Compliance Requirements

### SOC 2 Compliance
- Access controls and authentication
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Incident response procedures

### GDPR Compliance
- Data protection by design and default
- Right to data portability and deletion
- Privacy impact assessments
- Data processing agreements

### Financial Regulations
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- SOX compliance for financial reporting
- Regular security assessments and audits

## üîß Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review security logs and alerts
2. **Monthly**: Run comprehensive security tests
3. **Quarterly**: Security configuration reviews
4. **Annually**: Full security assessment and penetration testing

### Dependency Management
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# Update dependencies
pnpm update

# Fix security issues
pnpm audit fix
```

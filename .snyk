ignore:

# Note: Some XSS and open redirect warnings are false positives because:
# 1. We validate URLs using validateSafeUrl() before use
# 2. blob: URLs from createObjectURL() are browser-generated and safe
# 3. Static analysis tools can't always track validation through function calls
# All user-controlled inputs are properly sanitized before use.

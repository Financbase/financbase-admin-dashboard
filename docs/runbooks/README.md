# Operational Runbooks

This directory contains operational runbooks for common issues and maintenance tasks in the Financbase Admin Dashboard.

## What are Runbooks?

Runbooks are step-by-step procedures for operational tasks, troubleshooting, and incident response. They help:

- Resolve issues quickly and consistently

3. **Symptoms**: How to identify the issue
4. **Root Cause**: Common causes

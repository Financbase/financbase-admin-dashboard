## Introduction to Workflows

Workflows are automated sequences of actions that respond to triggers in your business. They help you:

- **Save Time**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Reduce Errors**: Ensure consistent processes
- **Improve Efficiency**: Handle multiple actions simultaneously
- **Enhance Customer Experience**: Provide timely communications

### Types of Workflows

#### 1. Event-Based Workflows
Triggered by specific events in your system:
- Invoice created
- Payment received
- Expense approved
- Client added

#### 2. Schedule-Based Workflows
Run at predetermined times:
- Daily reports
- Weekly summaries
- Monthly reminders
- Quarterly reviews

#### 3. Manual Workflows
Triggered by user action:
- On-demand reports
- Bulk operations
- Testing scenarios

## Creating Your First Workflow

### Step 1: Choose a Template

1. Navigate to **Workflows** â†’ **Create Workflow**
2. Browse available templates:
   - **Invoice Reminder**: Send payment reminders
   - **Payment Confirmation**: Notify customers of payments
   - **Expense Approval**: Route expenses for approval
   - **Client Onboarding**: Welcome new clients
   - **Monthly Summary**: Generate monthly reports

3. Select a template or start from scratch

### Step 2: Configure the Trigger

#### Event Triggers
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "invoice.created",
  "conditions": {
    "amount": "> 1000",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

#### Schedule Triggers
```json
{
  "type": "schedule",
  "cron": "0 9 * * 1",
  "timezone": "UTC"
}
```

#### Manual Triggers
```json
{
  "type": "manual",
  "description": "Send payment reminder"
}
```

### Step 3: Add Actions

#### Email Actions
```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "config": {
    "to": "{{customerEmail}}",
    "subject": "Invoice {{invoiceNumber}} Reminder",
    "body": "Your invoice for {{amount}} is due on {{dueDate}}.",
    "template": "invoice-reminder"
  }
}
```

#### Webhook Actions
```json
{
  "type": "webhook",
  "config": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/notify",
    "method": "POST",

      "Authorization": "Bearer {{apiKey}}"
    },
    "body": {
      "event": "invoice.reminder",
      "data": "{{invoiceData}}"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Database Actions

    },
    "data": {
      "status": "reminder_sent",
      "lastReminderAt": "{{now}}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Workflow

1. Click **Test Workflow**
2. Provide test data:
   ```json
   {
     "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
     "invoiceNumber": "INV-001",
     "amount": "$1,000.00",
     "dueDate": "2024-02-01"
   }
   ```
3. Review the test results
4. Make adjustments if needed

### Step 5: Activate the Workflow

  "type": "parallel",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "config": {
        "to": "{{customerEmail}}",

      }
    },
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "config": {
        "url": "https://api.example.com/notify"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Conditional Branching

Execute different actions based on conditions:

```json
{
  "type": "condition",
  "condition": "{{amount}} > 1000",
  "trueActions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "config": {
        "to": "manager@company.com",
        "subject": "High Value Payment"
      }
    }
  ],
  "falseActions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "config": {
        "to": "{{customerEmail}}",
        "subject": "Payment Confirmation"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Loops and Iterations

Process multiple items:

```json
{
  "type": "loop",
  "items": "{{invoices}}",
  "action": {
    "type": "email",
    "config": {
      "to": "{{item.customerEmail}}",
      "subject": "Invoice {{item.number}}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

Handle failures gracefully:

```json
{
  "type": "try",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "config": {
        "url": "https://api.example.com/notify"
      }
    }
  ],
  "onError": {
    "type": "email",
    "config": {
      "to": "admin@company.com",
      "subject": "Webhook Failed"
    }
  }
}
```

### Retry Logic

Automatically retry failed actions:

```json
{
  "type": "retry",
  "maxAttempts": 3,
  "delay": "5m",
  "action": {
    "type": "webhook",
    "config": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/notify"
    }
  }
}
```

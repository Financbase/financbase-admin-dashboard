## 🚨 Critical Notes

1. **Transaction Type Migration**: All services and UI components have been updated to use the new transaction types (`income`, `expense`, `transfer`, `payment`). Ensure all team members are aware of this change.

2. **Schema Validation**: The CI/CD pipeline includes automated schema validation. Any schema changes must pass validation before deployment.

3. **Environment Variables**: All environment templates have been standardized. Use the appropriate template for each environment.

4. **Testing**: E2E tests are now configured to run automatically. Ensure all tests pass before deploying to production.

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Page shows "Loading..."

**Cause**: Data fetching in progress  
**Solution**: Wait a moment, or check Network tab for API errors

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error

**Solution**: Sign out and sign in again

### Issue: Empty lists

**Cause**: No data in database yet  
**Solution**: This is expected! Create some test data

### Issue: Console warnings

**Cause**: Development mode warnings (React, Next.js)  
**Solution**: Safe to ignore if not errors

### Issue: AI not responding

## üìù Developer Notes

### Cache Management

- **Issue:** Webpack runtime errors after file changes
- **Solution:** Clear `.next` directory when errors persist
- **Command:** `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Clerk Integration

- **Provider:** Must wrap entire app in root `providers.tsx`
- **Components:** Need `'use client'` directive
- **Development:** Shows warnings about development keys (expected)
- **Workers:** CSP-related worker errors (non-blocking, Clerk-specific)

### Hot Reload

- Fast Refresh generally stable
- Full reloads occur after provider changes
- Auth pages take longer to compile (Clerk dependencies)

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Always clear cache for module errors** - Webpack runtime errors often resolve with cache clear
2. **Root-level providers are critical** - ClerkProvider must wrap entire app
3. **Client components need directives** - `'use client'` required for Clerk components
4. **Health checks should be public** - Essential for monitoring and DevOps
5. **Professional landing pages matter** - First impression impacts user trust

---

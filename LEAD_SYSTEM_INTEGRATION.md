# Lead System Integration Setup

## Overview

The lead management system is now fully integrated with both contact forms and user signups. Here's how it works:

## ‚úÖ **What's Implemented**

### 1. **Contact Form ‚Üí Lead Creation**
- **File**: `app/api/contact/route.ts`
- **Functionality**: When users submit the contact form, it automatically creates a lead
- **Lead Source**: `website`
- **Priority**: `medium`
- **Data Captured**: Name, email, company, message

### 2. **User Signup ‚Üí Lead Creation**
- **File**: `app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`
- **Functionality**: When users sign up via Clerk, it automatically creates a lead
- **Lead Source**: `signup`
- **Priority**: `high` (new signups are high priority)
- **Data Captured**: First name, last name, email, Clerk user ID

### 3. **Functional Contact Form**
- **File**: `app/(public)/contact/page.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Fully functional contact form with validation and submission
- **Features**: Form validation, error handling, success messages, loading states

## üîß **Setup Required**

### 1. **Clerk Webhook Configuration**

To enable automatic lead creation from signups, you need to configure a Clerk webhook:

#### In Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to **Webhooks** in your Clerk Dashboard
2. Click **Add Endpoint**
3. Set the endpoint URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
4. Select the **user.created** event
5. Copy the webhook secret

#### Environment Variables:
Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 2. **System User for Lead Management**

The contact form creates leads with a system user ID. In production, you should:

1. Create a dedicated system user in your database
2. Update the `systemUserId` in `app/api/contact/route.ts` to use the real system user ID

## üìä **Lead Data Structure**

### Contact Form Leads:
```json
{
  "userId": "system-lead-manager",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "source": "website",
  "priority": "medium",
  "notes": "Contact form submission: I'm interested in your services...",
  "metadata": {
    "formType": "contact",
    "originalMessage": "I'm interested in your services...",
    "submittedAt": "2025-01-21T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Signup Leads:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_2abc123def456",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com", 
  "source": "signup",
  "priority": "high",
  "notes": "Lead created from user signup",
  "metadata": {
    "clerkUserId": "user_2abc123def456",
    "signupMethod": "email",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-21T10:30:00.000Z",
    "webhookEvent": "user.created"
  }
}
```
